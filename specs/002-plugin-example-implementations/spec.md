# Feature Specification: Add Plugin Example Implementations

**Feature Branch**: `002-plugin-example-implementations`  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add plugin example implementations"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Basic Plugin Template Example (Priority: P1)

As a plugin developer new to the FDO SDK, I want to see a complete, working example of a basic plugin that demonstrates the core SDK features (init, render, logging) so that I can quickly understand how to create my first plugin.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for all plugin development. Without a clear basic example, developers cannot get started with the SDK. This provides immediate value by reducing the learning curve and time-to-first-plugin.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new plugin based on the example, running it in the FDO application, and verifying that it initializes and renders correctly. Delivers immediate value by enabling developers to create their first working plugin.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has installed the FDO SDK, **When** they examine the basic plugin example, **Then** they can see clear implementation of FDO_SDK extension, metadata definition, init() method, and render() method
2. **Given** a developer copies the basic plugin example, **When** they load it in the FDO application, **Then** the plugin initializes successfully and displays rendered content
3. **Given** a developer is reading the basic example, **When** they look at the code comments, **Then** they understand what each section does and why it's necessary

### User Story 2 - Interactive Plugin with UI Components (Priority: P2)

As a plugin developer building interactive features, I want to see an example plugin that uses DOM generation classes (DOMButton, DOMInput, DOMText, etc.) and handles user interactions through message handlers so that I can build rich user interfaces in my plugins.

**Why this priority**: After understanding the basics, developers need to build interactive plugins. This example demonstrates the SDK's UI capabilities and IPC communication patterns, which are essential for most real-world plugins.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the example plugin, interacting with its UI elements (clicking buttons, entering text), and verifying that the plugin responds correctly to user actions. Delivers value by enabling developers to create interactive plugins.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer examines the interactive plugin example, **When** they review the code, **Then** they see how to use DOMButton, DOMInput, DOMText, and DOMNested classes to create UI elements
2. **Given** a developer runs the interactive plugin, **When** they click a button or interact with an input field, **Then** the plugin handles the interaction through registered message handlers
3. **Given** a developer wants to add custom interactions, **When** they follow the example pattern, **Then** they can register their own handlers using PluginRegistry.registerHandler()

---

### User Story 3 - Data Persistence Plugin Example (Priority: P3)

As a plugin developer building stateful applications, I want to see an example plugin that demonstrates data persistence using the storage system (StoreDefault, StoreJson) so that I can save and retrieve plugin data across sessions.

**Why this priority**: Many plugins need to persist data, but this is not critical for initial plugin development. Developers can build functional plugins without persistence, making this a lower priority than basic and interactive examples.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the example plugin, saving data, restarting the FDO application, and verifying that the data persists. Delivers value by enabling developers to build stateful plugins.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer examines the persistence plugin example, **When** they review the storage code, **Then** they see how to use PluginRegistry.useStore() to access storage backends
2. **Given** a developer runs the persistence plugin, **When** they save data and restart the application, **Then** the data is successfully retrieved from storage
3. **Given** a developer wants to use JSON file storage, **When** they follow the example, **Then** they can register and use StoreJson for persistent storage

---

### User Story 4 - Advanced Plugin with Quick Actions and Side Panel (Priority: P4)

As a plugin developer building comprehensive integrations, I want to see an example plugin that demonstrates advanced features like QuickActions and SidePanel configurations so that I can extend the FDO application's UI with custom shortcuts and panels.

**Why this priority**: These are advanced features that enhance plugin integration but are not essential for basic plugin functionality. Developers should master the fundamentals before implementing these features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading the example plugin and verifying that quick actions appear in the FDO application's quick action menu and that the side panel is properly configured. Delivers value by enabling developers to create deeply integrated plugins.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer examines the advanced plugin example, **When** they review the mixin usage, **Then** they see how to use QuickActionMixin and SidePanelMixin
2. **Given** a developer runs the advanced plugin, **When** they access the FDO application's quick actions, **Then** they see the plugin's custom quick actions
3. **Given** a developer wants to add a side panel, **When** they follow the example pattern, **Then** they can define a side panel configuration with custom menu items

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a plugin example is copied but the developer forgets to change the plugin name/metadata? (Should have clear comments warning about this)
- How does the system handle when a developer tries to use a storage backend that hasn't been registered?
- What happens when a plugin example uses DOM classes but doesn't properly handle CSS generation?
- How should examples handle errors gracefully to demonstrate best practices?
- What happens when a developer tries to register duplicate message handlers?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: SDK MUST provide at least 4 complete, working plugin examples in the examples/ directory
- **FR-002**: Each example MUST be a standalone, runnable plugin that can be loaded in the FDO application
- **FR-003**: Examples MUST include comprehensive inline comments explaining each section of code
- **FR-004**: Examples MUST demonstrate progressively complex features (basic → interactive → persistence → advanced)
- **FR-005**: Each example MUST include a README or header comment explaining what it demonstrates and when to use it
- **FR-006**: Examples MUST follow the same code quality standards as the SDK itself (TypeScript, proper typing, error handling)
- **FR-007**: Examples MUST demonstrate proper use of the FDO_SDK base class and FDOInterface
- **FR-008**: Interactive examples MUST demonstrate proper message handler registration and IPC communication
- **FR-009**: Persistence examples MUST demonstrate both in-memory (StoreDefault) and file-based (StoreJson) storage
- **FR-010**: Advanced examples MUST demonstrate QuickActionMixin and SidePanelMixin usage
- **FR-011**: Examples MUST include proper error handling and logging to demonstrate best practices
- **FR-012**: Each example MUST have unique, descriptive metadata (name, version, author, description)
- **FR-013**: Examples MUST be referenced in the main SDK documentation/README
- **FR-014**: Examples MUST use realistic use cases that developers can relate to (e.g., todo list, note-taking, settings panel)
- **FR-015**: Examples MUST demonstrate proper CSS-in-JS usage with the DOM generation classes
