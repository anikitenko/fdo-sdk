## Critical Clarifications (Must Resolve Before Planning)

### C1: Example File Naming and Organization

**Question**: How should the example files be named and organized within the examples/ directory?

**Current State**: The specification mentions "at least 4 complete, working plugin examples" but doesn't specify naming conventions or directory structure.

**Options**:
1. Flat structure with descriptive names (e.g., `basic-plugin.ts`, `interactive-plugin.ts`, `persistence-plugin.ts`, `advanced-plugin.ts`)
2. Numbered structure matching priority (e.g., `01-basic-plugin.ts`, `02-interactive-plugin.ts`, etc.)
3. Categorized subdirectories (e.g., `examples/basic/`, `examples/intermediate/`, `examples/advanced/`)
4. Use case-based names (e.g., `todo-list-plugin.ts`, `note-taking-plugin.ts`, `settings-panel-plugin.ts`)

**Recommendation**: Use numbered structure with descriptive names (Option 2) for clear progression, combined with use case-based naming (Option 4) for relatability. Example: `01-basic-hello-world.ts`, `02-interactive-todo-list.ts`, `03-persistent-notes.ts`, `04-advanced-settings-panel.ts`

**Impact**: High - affects file structure and documentation references

---

### C2: Example Plugin Realistic Use Cases

**Question**: What specific realistic use cases should each example demonstrate?

**Current State**: FR-014 mentions "realistic use cases that developers can relate to (e.g., todo list, note-taking, settings panel)" but doesn't assign specific use cases to each example.

**Proposed Mapping**:
- **Basic Example (P1)**: "Hello World" plugin - displays a simple greeting with plugin metadata
- **Interactive Example (P2)**: Todo List plugin - demonstrates buttons, inputs, and state management
- **Persistence Example (P3)**: Note-Taking plugin - demonstrates saving and loading notes across sessions
- **Advanced Example (P4)**: Settings Panel plugin - demonstrates quick actions, side panel, and complex UI

**Rationale**: These use cases are universally understood, progressively complex, and demonstrate real-world plugin patterns.

**Impact**: High - defines the scope and complexity of each example

---

### C3: Documentation Location and Format

**Question**: Where should example documentation be placed, and in what format?

**Current State**: FR-005 mentions "README or header comment" but doesn't specify which approach to use or if both should be used.

**Options**:
1. Header comments only (inline documentation)
2. Separate README.md in examples/ directory
3. Both header comments and README.md
4. Individual README.md for each example in subdirectories

**Recommendation**: Use both (Option 3):
- Comprehensive header comments in each example file (for developers reading the code)
- Single `examples/README.md` that provides overview, lists all examples, and explains progression
- Update main SDK README.md to reference the examples

**Impact**: Medium - affects documentation structure and developer experience

---

## Important Clarifications (Should Resolve Before Implementation)

### C4: Example Code Style and Patterns

**Question**: Should examples follow a specific code style or pattern that differs from production code for educational purposes?

**Current State**: FR-006 states examples must follow "same code quality standards as the SDK itself" but doesn't clarify if examples should be more verbose/explicit for educational purposes.

**Considerations**:
- Should examples use more explicit typing even when inference would work?
- Should examples include more error handling than strictly necessary to demonstrate best practices?
- Should examples use longer, more descriptive variable names for clarity?
- Should examples avoid advanced TypeScript features to remain accessible?

**Recommendation**: Examples should be slightly more verbose and explicit than production code:
- Use explicit type annotations even when inference works
- Include comprehensive error handling with explanatory log messages
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `todoItemText` instead of `text`)
- Add comments explaining "why" not just "what"
- Avoid advanced TypeScript features unless demonstrating them is the example's purpose

**Impact**: Medium - affects code readability and educational value

---

### C5: Testing Strategy for Examples

**Question**: How should examples be tested to ensure they remain functional as the SDK evolves?

**Current State**: SC-002 states "Each example runs successfully in the FDO application without errors" but doesn't specify how this will be verified.

**Options**:
1. Manual testing only (run each example and verify behavior)
2. Automated unit tests for example plugins
3. Integration tests that load examples in a test FDO environment
4. CI/CD pipeline that builds and validates examples
5. Combination of manual and automated testing

**Recommendation**: Use combination approach (Option 5):
- Add automated build validation in CI/CD to ensure examples compile without errors
- Include examples in the existing test suite to verify they can be instantiated
- Document manual testing steps in examples/README.md
- Consider adding integration tests in future if FDO test environment becomes available

**Impact**: Medium - affects long-term maintainability and quality assurance

---

### C6: Example Plugin Metadata Standards

**Question**: What metadata standards should examples follow to avoid conflicts and confusion?

**Current State**: FR-012 requires "unique, descriptive metadata" but doesn't specify conventions.

**Considerations**:
- Should all examples use a common author (e.g., "FDO SDK Team")?
- Should example names include "Example" suffix (e.g., "Todo List Example Plugin")?
- Should versions all start at 1.0.0 or follow SDK version?
- Should descriptions follow a template format?

**Recommendation**:
- Author: "FDO SDK Team" (consistent across all examples)
- Name: Include "Example" suffix (e.g., "Todo List Example")
- Version: Start at 1.0.0 (independent of SDK version)
- Description: Follow template: "Example plugin demonstrating [features]. Shows how to [key learning points]."
- Icon: Use consistent placeholder icons or simple emoji-based icons

**Impact**: Low - affects metadata consistency but not functionality

## Nice-to-Have Clarifications (Can Resolve During Implementation)

### C7: Example Complexity and Length

**Question**: What is the target length/complexity for each example to balance completeness with readability?

**Current State**: No specific guidance on example size.

**Recommendation**:
- Basic example: 50-100 lines of code (excluding comments)
- Interactive example: 100-200 lines of code
- Persistence example: 150-250 lines of code
- Advanced example: 200-300 lines of code
- Aim for 30-40% comment-to-code ratio (per SC-004)

**Impact**: Low - provides guidance but can be adjusted during implementation

---

### C8: Example Styling and Visual Design

**Question**: Should examples include styled UI or use minimal/default styling?

**Current State**: FR-015 requires "proper CSS-in-JS usage" but doesn't specify styling expectations.

**Options**:
1. Minimal styling (focus on functionality)
2. Basic styling (clean but simple)
3. Polished styling (production-ready appearance)

**Recommendation**: Use basic styling (Option 2):
- Examples should look clean and professional but not overly designed
- Focus on demonstrating CSS-in-JS patterns rather than visual design
- Use simple color schemes and layouts
- Include comments explaining styling choices

**Impact**: Low - affects visual appearance but not core functionality

---

## Decisions Made

Based on the clarifications above, the following decisions are recommended for the planning phase:

1. **File Structure**: Use numbered, use-case-based naming in flat examples/ directory
2. **Use Cases**: Hello World (basic), Todo List (interactive), Note-Taking (persistence), Settings Panel (advanced)
3. **Documentation**: Both inline comments and examples/README.md, plus main README update
4. **Code Style**: Slightly more verbose and explicit than production code for educational purposes
5. **Testing**: Automated build validation + manual testing documentation
6. **Metadata**: Consistent standards with "FDO SDK Team" author and "Example" suffix in names
7. **Complexity**: Target 50-300 lines per example with 30-40% comment ratio
8. **Styling**: Basic, clean styling that demonstrates CSS-in-JS without over-designing

---

## Open Questions for User/Stakeholder

None at this time. All critical and important clarifications have been addressed with recommendations. If any decisions need to be changed, they can be adjusted during the planning phase.

## Next Steps

With these clarifications in place, we can proceed to the **speckit.plan** phase to create a detailed technical implementation plan.
