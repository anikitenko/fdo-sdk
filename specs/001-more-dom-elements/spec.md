# Feature Specification: Add More DOM Elements

**Feature Branch**: `001-more-dom-elements`  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add ability to create more DOM elements"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Create Data Tables in Plugin UI (Priority: P1)

As a plugin developer, I need to display tabular data in my plugin's UI using table elements (table, thead, tbody, tr, th, td) so that users can view structured information in a clear, organized format.

**Why this priority**: Tables are one of the most common UI patterns for displaying structured data. Many plugins need to show lists of items, configuration settings, or reports in tabular format. This is a fundamental building block that enables a wide range of plugin use cases.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a plugin that uses the new DOMTable class to generate a simple table with headers and data rows, then verifying the rendered HTML output contains proper table structure with correct styling and IDs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a plugin developer wants to display a list of items, **When** they use DOMTable.createTable() with headers and rows, **Then** a properly structured HTML table is generated with thead, tbody, th, and td elements
2. **Given** a plugin needs custom styling on table cells, **When** they pass style options to createTableCell(), **Then** the cell is rendered with the specified CSS classes and inline styles
3. **Given** a plugin wants to add a table caption, **When** they use createCaption() method, **Then** a caption element is added to the table with proper positioning

### User Story 2 - Display Images and Media in Plugins (Priority: P2)

As a plugin developer, I need to embed images, icons, and other media elements in my plugin UI so that I can create visually rich interfaces with logos, screenshots, and visual feedback.

**Why this priority**: Visual elements are essential for modern UI design. Plugins often need to display icons, logos, status indicators, or preview images. This enables more engaging and informative user interfaces.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a plugin that uses DOMMedia.createImage() to display an image with alt text and custom dimensions, then verifying the img element is rendered with correct src, alt, width, and height attributes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a plugin needs to display an icon, **When** they use DOMMedia.createImage() with src and alt text, **Then** an img element is generated with proper accessibility attributes
2. **Given** a plugin wants responsive images, **When** they pass style options with width/height, **Then** the image is rendered with appropriate sizing CSS
3. **Given** a plugin needs to handle missing images, **When** they provide alt text, **Then** the alt text is properly set for accessibility

### User Story 3 - Create Semantic Page Sections (Priority: P3)

As a plugin developer, I need to use semantic HTML5 elements (article, section, nav, header, footer, aside, main) to structure my plugin's UI so that the content is more accessible and semantically meaningful.

**Why this priority**: Semantic HTML improves accessibility, SEO, and code maintainability. While not immediately critical for functionality, it represents best practices and helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand content structure.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a plugin that uses DOMSemantic.createSection() and createHeader() to structure content, then verifying the rendered HTML uses proper semantic tags instead of generic divs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a plugin has distinct content sections, **When** they use createSection() for each section, **Then** section elements are generated with appropriate IDs and classes
2. **Given** a plugin has a navigation menu, **When** they use createNav() with child elements, **Then** a nav element is generated containing the navigation structure
3. **Given** a plugin has header/footer content, **When** they use createHeader() and createFooter(), **Then** proper semantic elements are generated for page structure

---

### User Story 4 - Create Ordered and Definition Lists (Priority: P3)

As a plugin developer, I need to create ordered lists (ol) and definition lists (dl, dt, dd) in addition to the existing unordered lists, so that I can display numbered sequences and term-definition pairs appropriately.

**Why this priority**: Different list types serve different purposes. Ordered lists are essential for step-by-step instructions or ranked items. Definition lists are perfect for glossaries, metadata, or key-value pairs. This completes the list element coverage.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a plugin that uses DOMNested.createOrderedList() with list items and verifying the rendered HTML contains an ol element with proper li children and sequential numbering.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a plugin needs to show numbered steps, **When** they use createOrderedList() with list items, **Then** an ol element is generated with proper li children
2. **Given** a plugin needs to display key-value pairs, **When** they use createDefinitionList() with terms and definitions, **Then** a dl element is generated with dt and dd pairs
3. **Given** a plugin wants custom list styling, **When** they pass style options, **Then** the list elements are rendered with specified CSS classes

---

### User Story 5 - Create Interactive Select Dropdowns (Priority: P2)

As a plugin developer, I need to create select dropdowns with options and optgroups so that users can choose from predefined values in forms and configuration interfaces.

**Why this priority**: Select dropdowns are a fundamental form control. Many plugins need configuration options or filters that require users to select from a list of choices. This is essential for interactive plugin UIs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a plugin that uses DOMInput.createSelect() with multiple options, then verifying the rendered HTML contains a select element with proper option children and event handlers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a plugin needs a dropdown menu, **When** they use createSelect() with option values and labels, **Then** a select element is generated with option children
2. **Given** a plugin needs grouped options, **When** they use createOptgroup() within a select, **Then** optgroup elements properly organize the options
3. **Given** a plugin needs to handle selection changes, **When** they attach an onChange handler, **Then** the handler is properly bound to the select element

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a table is created with no rows or columns? The system should generate a valid but empty table structure with thead/tbody elements.
- What happens when an image src is invalid or points to a non-existent file? The img element should still render with alt text visible and proper error handling.
- What happens when nested elements exceed reasonable depth (e.g., 50+ levels of nested divs)? The system should handle deep nesting without stack overflow or performance degradation.
- What happens when style options conflict with default classes? User-provided styles should take precedence over defaults, with proper CSS specificity.
- What happens when special characters or HTML entities are used in content? Content should be properly escaped to prevent XSS vulnerabilities while allowing legitimate HTML entities.
- What happens when very large tables (1000+ rows) are created? The system should generate valid HTML without memory issues, though rendering performance is the client's responsibility.
- What happens when event handlers are attached to elements that don't support them? The system should allow any event handler on any element, following HTML5 standards.
- What happens when custom attributes are provided that conflict with standard HTML attributes? Custom attributes should be merged properly, with explicit attributes taking precedence.
- What happens when semantic elements are nested incorrectly (e.g., header inside header)? The system should generate the requested structure, as validation is the developer's responsibility.
- What happens when select elements are created with no options? A valid but empty select element should be generated.
