# Phase 0: Research - Plugin Example Implementations

**Feature**: Plugin Example Implementations  
**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Tasks

### 1. Example Plugin Patterns in Similar SDKs

**Task**: Research best practices for SDK example implementations in similar plugin frameworks (Electron, VS Code extensions, browser extensions).

**Findings**:
- **Progressive Complexity**: Most successful SDK examples follow a progressive learning path from "Hello World" to advanced features
- **Self-Contained Examples**: Each example should be independently runnable without dependencies on other examples
- **Inline Documentation**: 20-30% documentation-to-code ratio is standard for educational examples
- **Version Compatibility**: Examples typically specify compatibility using version ranges (e.g., "SDK v1.x") in header comments
- **File Naming**: Numbered prefixes (01-, 02-) are common for indicating learning progression

**Decision**: Adopt progressive complexity pattern with numbered prefixes and comprehensive inline documentation.

**Rationale**: This approach has proven successful in major SDK ecosystems (VS Code, Electron) and aligns with adult learning principles of scaffolding.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Grouping by feature area (rejected: loses learning progression)
- Single comprehensive example (rejected: too complex for beginners)
- Separate documentation files (rejected: reduces discoverability)

### 2. TypeScript Example Best Practices

**Task**: Identify TypeScript-specific best practices for example code.

**Findings**:
- **Explicit Types**: Examples should use explicit type annotations even when inference would work, for educational clarity
- **Interface Usage**: Demonstrate proper interface implementation (FDOInterface)
- **Strict Mode**: All examples should compile with strict mode enabled
- **JSDoc Comments**: Include JSDoc for all public methods to demonstrate documentation practices
- **Error Handling**: Show proper try-catch patterns and error logging

**Decision**: Use explicit typing throughout examples with comprehensive JSDoc comments.

**Rationale**: Examples serve as reference implementations. Explicit types make the code more educational even if slightly more verbose.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Type inference (rejected: less educational for beginners)
- Minimal comments (rejected: doesn't meet 20% documentation requirement)

### 3. Plugin Lifecycle Demonstration Patterns

**Task**: Determine the best way to demonstrate plugin lifecycle (init, render) in examples.

**Findings**:
- **Init Method**: Should demonstrate setup tasks like handler registration, store initialization, logging setup
- **Render Method**: Should show both simple HTML strings and DOM helper class usage
- **Metadata**: Should demonstrate all required metadata fields (name, version, author, description, icon)
- **Logging**: Should show proper use of this.log() and this.error() methods

**Decision**: Each example will demonstrate appropriate lifecycle usage for its complexity level, with comments explaining when each method is called.

**Rationale**: Understanding lifecycle is fundamental to plugin development. Examples should make the execution flow explicit.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Lifecycle diagram in separate file (rejected: reduces self-containment)
- Minimal lifecycle usage (rejected: doesn't demonstrate best practices)

### 4. Storage System Demonstration

**Task**: Research best practices for demonstrating the storage system (StoreDefault, StoreJson).

**Findings**:
- **Store Selection**: StoreDefault for temporary data, StoreJson for persistent data
- **Key Naming**: Use namespaced keys (e.g., "pluginName:settingName") to avoid conflicts
- **Error Handling**: Storage operations can fail (permissions, disk space) and should be wrapped in try-catch
- **Data Serialization**: StoreJson handles JSON serialization automatically

**Decision**: Example 03 will demonstrate both storage backends with proper error handling and key naming conventions.

**Rationale**: Storage is a common plugin requirement. Demonstrating both backends helps developers choose appropriately.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Only demonstrate one storage type (rejected: doesn't show full capability)
- Custom storage implementation (rejected: out of scope, adds complexity)

### 5. DOM Generation Patterns

**Task**: Identify effective patterns for demonstrating the DOM generation system.

**Findings**:
- **Progressive Adoption**: Start with simple HTML strings, progress to DOM helper classes
- **Styling**: Demonstrate both inline styles and CSS-in-JS via goober
- **Component Composition**: Show how to combine multiple DOM elements into complex UIs
- **Event Handling**: Demonstrate onClick handlers and form input handling

**Decision**: Example 01 uses simple HTML strings, Example 05 demonstrates full DOM helper class usage with styling.

**Rationale**: Progressive complexity allows developers to start simple and adopt advanced features as needed.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Only DOM helpers (rejected: too complex for beginners)
- Only HTML strings (rejected: doesn't demonstrate SDK capabilities)
- Separate styling example (rejected: would require 6 examples)

## Technical Decisions Summary

| Decision | Choice | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| File Organization | Flat structure with numbered prefixes | Clear progression, easy navigation |
| Documentation Ratio | 20-30% inline comments | Meets educational goals without overwhelming |
| Type Safety | Explicit types with strict mode | Better learning experience, demonstrates best practices |
| Storage Demo | Both StoreDefault and StoreJson | Complete coverage of storage options |
| DOM Progression | HTML strings â†’ DOM helpers | Gradual learning curve |
| Version Compatibility | Comment header with version range | Low maintenance, clear compatibility |

## Unresolved Questions

None - all clarifications were resolved during the clarify phase.

## Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- Create data-model.md (minimal - examples are code artifacts)
- Create quickstart.md for developers using the examples
- No API contracts needed (examples use existing SDK APIs)
