**Feature Branch**: `002-plugin-examples`  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add plugin example implementations"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-27

- Q: How many distinct example plugin files should be created? → A: 5 examples (one per user story)
- Q: How should the example files be organized within the examples directory? → A: Flat structure with numbered prefixes (e.g., 01-basic-plugin.ts, 02-interactive-plugin.ts)
- Q: How should SDK version compatibility be specified in each example? → A: Version range in comment header (e.g., "Compatible with SDK v1.x")
- Q: What types of plugin examples should be explicitly excluded from this feature? → A: Exclude production-ready and deployment examples (out of scope: production deployment, CI/CD pipelines, comprehensive testing, monitoring setup)
- Q: How should example output/screenshots be documented? → A: Inline comments with text description

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Plugin Creation (Priority: P1)

A new plugin developer wants to understand the minimal requirements to create a working FDO plugin. They need a simple, well-documented example that demonstrates the core plugin lifecycle (initialization and rendering) without additional complexity.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for all plugin development. Without understanding the basic structure, developers cannot proceed to more advanced features. This represents the minimum viable knowledge needed to create any plugin.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new plugin file following the basic example, running it in the FDO application, and verifying it initializes and renders content successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has the FDO SDK installed, **When** they copy the basic plugin example and run it, **Then** the plugin initializes without errors and displays simple content
2. **Given** a developer reviews the basic example code, **When** they read the inline documentation, **Then** they understand what each required method (init, render) does and why it's needed
3. **Given** a developer wants to modify the example, **When** they change the rendered content, **Then** their changes appear in the FDO application without breaking functionality

---

### User Story 2 - Interactive Plugin with UI Actions (Priority: P2)

A plugin developer wants to create interactive functionality where users can click buttons, fill forms, and trigger custom actions. They need an example showing how to handle user interactions through the message-based communication system.

**Why this priority**: Most useful plugins require user interaction. This builds on the basic example (P1) and demonstrates the communication layer that enables dynamic behavior, which is essential for practical plugin development.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by implementing the interactive example, clicking buttons and filling forms in the FDO application, and verifying that custom handlers execute and update the UI appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer implements the interactive example, **When** a user clicks a button in the plugin UI, **Then** the registered handler executes and the UI updates to reflect the action
2. **Given** a developer reviews the interactive example, **When** they examine the handler registration code, **Then** they understand how to register custom message handlers and process user input
3. **Given** a developer wants to add form validation, **When** they follow the example's input handling pattern, **Then** they can validate user input before processing

---

### User Story 3 - Data Persistence Plugin (Priority: P3)

A plugin developer needs to save and retrieve user data across application sessions. They need an example demonstrating how to use the storage system to persist plugin state and user preferences.

**Why this priority**: Data persistence is important for many plugins but not essential for basic functionality. This builds on P1 and P2 by showing how to maintain state, which enhances user experience but isn't required for a minimal working plugin.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by implementing the persistence example, saving data through the plugin, restarting the FDO application, and verifying the saved data is correctly retrieved and displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer implements the persistence example, **When** a user saves data through the plugin and restarts the application, **Then** the previously saved data is correctly loaded and displayed
2. **Given** a developer reviews the storage example, **When** they examine the store usage patterns, **Then** they understand how to choose between different storage backends (in-memory vs file-based)
3. **Given** a developer needs to clear stored data, **When** they follow the example's data management patterns, **Then** they can implement data clearing and updating functionality

---

### User Story 4 - Quick Actions and Side Panel Integration (Priority: P4)

A plugin developer wants to extend the FDO application's UI by adding quick action shortcuts and side panel menus. They need an example showing how to use mixins to register these UI extensions.

**Why this priority**: UI extensions enhance plugin discoverability and user experience but are optional features. This demonstrates advanced SDK capabilities that improve polish but aren't necessary for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by implementing the UI extension example, verifying quick actions appear in the application's quick action menu, and confirming side panel items are accessible and functional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer implements the quick actions example, **When** they apply the QuickActionMixin, **Then** their defined quick actions appear in the FDO application's quick action interface
2. **Given** a developer implements the side panel example, **When** they apply the SidePanelMixin, **Then** their side panel configuration appears in the application's side panel with correct icons and labels
3. **Given** a developer wants to trigger specific plugin functionality from quick actions, **When** they follow the example's message routing pattern, **Then** quick action selections correctly invoke the corresponding plugin handlers

---

### User Story 5 - Advanced DOM Generation (Priority: P5)

A plugin developer wants to create rich, styled UI components using the SDK's DOM generation classes. They need an example demonstrating how to use the various DOM helper classes (DOMText, DOMButton, DOMInput, etc.) to build complex interfaces with custom styling.

**Why this priority**: While important for creating polished UIs, developers can start with simple HTML strings (P1) and progressively adopt DOM helpers. This is an optimization and enhancement rather than a requirement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by implementing the DOM generation example, verifying the generated UI renders correctly with proper styling, and confirming all interactive elements function as expected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer implements the DOM generation example, **When** they use the DOM helper classes to create UI elements, **Then** the elements render with correct styling and structure
2. **Given** a developer reviews the styling examples, **When** they examine the CSS-in-JS patterns, **Then** they understand how to create custom styles using the goober integration
3. **Given** a developer wants to create a form with multiple input types, **When** they follow the example's patterns for combining DOM elements, **Then** they can build complex nested structures with proper event handling

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a plugin example is copied but required dependencies are missing from the developer's environment?
- How does the system handle when a developer modifies an example in a way that breaks the plugin lifecycle (e.g., missing required methods)?
- What happens when storage operations fail due to permission issues or disk space constraints?
- How does the system behave when a developer registers duplicate handlers or conflicting quick action names?
- What happens when DOM generation produces invalid HTML or CSS syntax?
- How does the system handle when a plugin example is run in an incompatible FDO SDK version?
