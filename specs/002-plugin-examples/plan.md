# Implementation Plan: Plugin Example Implementations

**Branch**: `002-plugin-examples` | **Date**: 2025-10-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-plugin-examples/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create 5 comprehensive plugin example implementations that demonstrate core FDO SDK capabilities. Examples will be organized in a flat directory structure with numbered prefixes (01-05) and progress from basic plugin creation to advanced DOM generation. Each example will include inline documentation, version compatibility information, and text descriptions of expected output. The examples will serve as primary learning resources for plugin developers and cover plugin lifecycle, UI interactions, data persistence, UI extensions, and DOM generation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.7.3 (matching existing SDK codebase)  
**Primary Dependencies**: @anikitenko/fdo-sdk (the SDK itself), electron ^35.0.0, goober ^2.1.16 (CSS-in-JS), winston ^3.17.0 (logging)  
**Storage**: StoreDefault (in-memory) and StoreJson (file-based) from SDK  
**Testing**: Jest ^29.7.0 with ts-jest ^29.2.5 (matching existing test infrastructure)  
**Target Platform**: Electron desktop application (cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single project (SDK examples within existing repository)  
**Performance Goals**: Examples must load and initialize in under 1 second, render UI in under 500ms  
**Constraints**: Examples must be self-contained, no external API dependencies, compatible with SDK v1.x  
**Scale/Scope**: 5 example files, approximately 100-300 lines each with 20%+ inline documentation

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Plugin Architecture Integrity
✅ **PASS** - Examples demonstrate the plugin architecture without modifying core SDK interfaces. All examples use existing stable APIs (FDO_SDK base class, lifecycle hooks, mixins).

### Type Safety and Developer Experience
✅ **PASS** - Examples will be written in TypeScript with strict mode enabled. All examples will use proper typing and demonstrate type-safe patterns for plugin developers.

### Testing and Quality Assurance
✅ **PASS** - Examples will include inline documentation and can be tested by running them in the FDO application. While examples themselves are reference implementations, they follow testable patterns that developers can adopt.

### Automated Release Management
✅ **PASS** - Examples will be included in the npm package distribution and versioned with the SDK. No changes to release automation required.

### Documentation and Examples
✅ **PASS** - This feature directly fulfills the constitution's requirement for "working example plugins that demonstrate core functionality." Examples will include comprehensive inline documentation.

**Overall Status**: All constitution principles are satisfied. No violations to justify.

tests/
└── ...                          # Existing tests (no changes for this feature)
```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure. All 5 example files will be added to the existing `examples/` directory with numbered prefixes (01-05) to indicate learning progression. No changes to existing SDK source code or tests are required - this is purely additive content in the examples directory.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations - this section is not applicable.
